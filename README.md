# Booking App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Booking App! This application allows you to choose a location and make a booking for your preferred date range. After booking, you can view, edit, and delete your bookings. Validations have been implemented to prevent overlapping bookings. Some data is mocked, with a focus on creating the app's core functionality.
